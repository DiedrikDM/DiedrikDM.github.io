<p>Hello to all! This is my first ever blog on anything programming related. I'm committing myself to write a post every week.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The subjects I'll post about are anything JavaScript or front-end related; or .NET Web Development stuff.</p>
<p>This page is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/diedrikdm/diedrikdm.github.io">Github Pages</a>, so you can actually help my blog along if you find spelling mistakes or other things!</p>
<p>Have fun and see you soon!</p>
